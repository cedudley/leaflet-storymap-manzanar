Executive Order 9066 was a United States presidential executive order signed and issued during World War II by United States president Franklin D. Roosevelt on February 19, 1942. Though it purpoted to apply to Italians and Germans in the US as well, only a small portion of these populations were incarcerated in US-based camps. Far more Americans of Asian descent were forcibly interned than Americans of European descent, both in total and as a share of relative population. Forced to urgently leave their homes, many people sold their homes at an enormous loss and lost their businesses."},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.39875,37.79135]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":5,"chapter":"Manzanar Today","zoom":19,"image":"img/manzanar_committee_event.jpeg","source-credit":"Source: Wikimedia","source-link":"https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ManzanarPilgrimageInterfaith2002.jpg","description":"The Manzanar Committee is an organization coming from the legacy of this activist movement to reclaim the site as a site of memory.
